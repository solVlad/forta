AgentRegistry

Agents are abstract objects identified by a unique uint256 value. Agents are owned, transferable, and come with attributes:

"metadata": string (in practice the ipfs hash of a descriptor)
"chainIds": (sorted) array of integers

Both the metadata and the chainIds are mutable through the updateAgent function that is restricted to the agent's owner.

At every point in time, a metadata entry can belong to at most one agent
no two agents can share the same metadata entry

Agents can be enabled / disabled either by their owner or by an admin
Each actor has independent "disable" flags

If an admin disables an agent, it takes an admin action to re-enable it (the owner cannot re-enable).

Similarly, if an owner disables an agent, an admin cannot re-enable it.

If the agent Id is staked under the minimum stake, it canâ€™t be enabled() will return false, regardless of the flags.




As metadata are unique, it is possible for someone to front-run the creation/update of an agent by creating a new agent, or updating an existing one, to take over the metadata entry

This should be avoided by adding a commit-reveal scheme with a delay to both functions (createAgent and updateAgent
