Scan Nodes

A scan node is a specific type of Forta node that executes detection bots for every transaction and every new block on a specific blockchain network.

The scan node ferries blockchain data to bots to process the transaction/block.


Scan nodes must produce proof of scan for every block, which provides the ability for community monitoring. Malicious or inaccurate scan nodes can be slashed and disabled.
